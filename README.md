<h1 align="center">Iris: Mobile-first interactive and identity interface</h1>

`Iris` is a mobile-first, installable web application that serves as the phone-oriented counterpart to my desktop portfolio, Lys.

While Lys focuses on technical breadth (projects, case studies, blogs), `Iris` focuses on **experiential clarity and depth** — presenting my work, philosophy, and systems thinking through interaction, motion, and spatial exploration.

## Purpose

Modern portfolios optimize for information density.  
`Iris` optimizes for **presence**.

The goal is not to list everything I have built, but to provide a clear, intentional entry point into how I think, design, and structure software systems.

`Iris` is designed to:
- be approachable on mobile devices
- load instantly from a URL
- feel native without requiring app-store installation
- remain minimal, durable, and extensible

## Experience Overview

`Iris` is structured as a small state-driven interactive system rather than a traditional page-based website.

### 1. Opening Ritual
A single-screen, tap-to-advance sequence that introduces intent and identity.
Scrolling is intentionally disabled at this stage to establish pacing and focus.

### 2. Identity Cards
A short, vertical sequence of cards that ground the experience in concrete areas of work:
- digital systems and inner-life software
- cognition, memory, and local-first design
- infrastructure and backend systems
- simulations and interactive worlds
- guiding philosophy

### 3. Observatory
A spatial, interactive environment where projects and ideas appear as constellations.
Users explore by scrolling, swiping, and touching elements rather than navigating menus.

## Interaction Model

- **Tap**: advance or acknowledge state
- **Vertical scroll**: move through depth
- **Horizontal swipe**: shift perspective
- **Touch / hold**: focus or reveal detail

No traditional navigation elements are used.

## Design Principles

- Essentialist visual language
- Dark-first color system with restrained highlights
- Motion used for continuity, not decoration
- Procedural visuals over static assets
- Minimal text, high signal

The interface is intended to remain calm, legible, and non-distracting across a wide range of devices.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Jaspr** (Dart → WebAssembly)
- **Canvas / WebGL** for rendering
- **Procedural graphics** (no image or video assets)
- **Finite state machine** for experience modes
- **Progressive Web App** (offline support, installable)

The project is built closer to a lightweight rendering engine than a conventional web app.

---

## Relationship to Other Projects

`Iris` acts as an entry layer and links outward to my mobile app implementations of in-depth projects, including:
- Nargis
- Eden
- Camellia

It is not intended to replace detailed documentation or case studies, which remain on the desktop portfolio.

---

## Status

Early-stage, actively evolving.

The structure and foundations are stable; content and constellations will expand gradually.
